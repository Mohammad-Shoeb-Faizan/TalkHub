# Chat Application Project

Welcome to the Chat Application project! This README is designed to help you understand the project, its components, and how it works without requiring any coding knowledge.

## Introduction

This project is a simple chat application that allows users to chat with each other. It consists of two main parts: the frontend (what users see and interact with) and the backend (server-side logic).

## Frontend

### What is Frontend?

The frontend is the part of the application that you, as a user, interact with directly. It's like the user interface of the chat application.

### How to Use the Frontend

1. **Authentication**: When you open the chat application, you will see a welcome screen asking you to set a username. Enter a username of your choice and click the "Enter" button.

2. **Chat Interface**: After entering your username, you'll be directed to the chat interface. Here, you can send and receive messages with other users.

## Backend

### What is Backend?

The backend is like the engine of the application that handles all the behind-the-scenes work, such as user authentication and message handling.

### How it Works

The backend is set up as a server using a technology called Express.js. It has a single endpoint (`/authenticate`) that handles user authentication.

### User Authentication

When you enter a username on the frontend and click "Enter," the frontend sends a request to the backend with your chosen username.

The backend then communicates with a service called Chat Engine to create or retrieve a user with that username. If successful, it sends back a response to the frontend, allowing you to access the chat interface.

## Technical Details

If you're curious about the technical details or need assistance from a developer, here are some key points:

- The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- The frontend uses a library called "react-chat-engine-pretty" to display the chat interface.

- The backend is powered by Express.js, a framework for building web applications in Node.js.

- User authentication is handled by making HTTP requests to the Chat Engine API.
